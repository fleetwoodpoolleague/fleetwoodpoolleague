		    <h1>Fleetwood and District Pool League Rules <small>Last Updated at the AGM, 3rd November 2013</small></h1>
			<dl>
  				<dt>1. THE GAME</dt>
  				<dd>
 The game shall be known as 8 Ball Pool and referred to in these rules as “The Game”. It is intended that players and teams should play 8 Ball Pool in the true spirit of the game and in a sportsmanlike manner. It should be clearly understood that the referee is the sole judge of what is fair and unfair play. The referee will take whatever action is necessary to ensure that these rules are observed.
				</dd>
			</dl>
			<dl>
				<dt>2. REQUIREMENTS OF THE GAME</dt>
				<dd>
The game is played on a rectangular 6-pocket table with 15 balls plus a cue ball. Balls comprise of two numbered groups, 1-7 which are solid coloured balls, 9-15 are striped coloured balls, the 8 ball is a solid colour black. Alternatively, the numerical groups 1-7 and 9-15 may be represented by two different sets of 7 coloured balls. Usually red replaces stripes (9-15), yellow replace solid (1-7). Balls in the two groups are known as object balls.
				</dd>
			</dl>
			<dl>
				<dt>3. OBJECT OF THE GAME</dt>
				<dd>The player or team pocketing all their group of object balls in any order, and then legally pocketing the 8 ball, wins the game.
				</dd>
			</dl>
			<dl>
				<dt>4. COMMENCEMENT OF THE GAME (OR RE-START)</dt>
				<dd>
					<ol type="A">
						<li>The balls are racked as illustrated on the rule sheet with the 8 ball (black) on the 8 ball spot, which is at the intersection of the centre and corner pockets.</li>
						<li>Order of play is determined by Tossing a coin, the winner of the coin toss has the option of breaking, or requesting their opponent to do so.</li>
						<li>The opening player plays at the triangle of object balls by striking the cue ball from any position on, or in the “D”. An object ball must be pocketed, or at least TWO object balls hit any cushion. Failure to do so is a foul break and will result in the balls be re-racked as per rule sheet. The opposing player then starts the game with two visits.</li>
						<li>If the 8 ball (black) is pocketed from the break shot, the balls will be re-racked and the game will be restarted by the same player. No penalty will be incurred. This applies even if other balls, including the cue ball, are pocketed, or leave the playing surface (“off the table”).</li>
						<li>On the first occasion a player legally pockets an object ball, including following a foul, then that ball denotes their group, unless one or more of both groups are pocketed, the player MUST then nominate a group before play continues. On the Break - If no Colours are potted on the break the table is “Open”. If one or more Colours are potted on the break the player then has a right and obligation to verbally advise the referee of a choice of Colour before proceeding. Failure to do so is a Standard Foul. If a player is fouled under this rule the opponent faces an “Open” table. If the player nominates a Colour that was potted on the break, the player is on that colour no matter what happens next. If the player nominates a Colour that was not potted on the break, to be on that Colour, the player must pot a ball of that Colour on the next shot.</li>
						<li>If no object ball is pocketed from a legal break, then the players continue alternately playing at either group until such a time as a legal pot is made, which decides the player’s group.</li>
						<li>If a foul is committed, (other than as in rule 4(D)), and one or more object balls are pocketed before playing groups are decided, then those balls are ignored in determining the groups to be played. The oncoming player may play at any ball on the table, including the 8 ball (black) for the first shot, the first legal pot to determine the group as in rule 4(E).</li>
						<li>If a ball, or balls, are legally pocketed, this entitles the player to one additional shot and this continues until the player either:
						<ol type="1">
							<li>Fails to pocket one of their own set of allocated balls, or;</li>
							<li>Commits a foul at any time.</li>
						</ol>
						</li>
						<li>I. Combination shots are allowed, providing the player hits one of their own group first, or any ball with the first shot following

					<li> Failing to hit any ball with the cue ball, except where rule 8(C) applies.</li>
					<li>Jump shot - defined as when the cue ball jumps over any part of any ball before making contact with any ball.</li>

					<li> Ball off the table.
						<ol type="1">

							<li> If the cue ball, then the cue ball played from in hand (see rule 8(B) general).</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					A ball shall be deemed “off the table” if it comes to rest anywhere other than on the bed of the table.
					<li>If a player’s body or clothing should touch any ball. Except the cue ball after the referee calls a “foul”, when the player is entitled to the cue ball in hand (see rule 6(B)).</li>

				</dd>
			</dl>
			<dl>
				<dt>6. PENALTY FOLLOWING ANY FOUL</li>
				<dd>
					<ol type="A">
						<li>Following any foul the offending player loses their next visit to the table, giving their opponent two consecutive visits to the table.</li>
						<li>If the cue ball has come to rest on the playing surface, then the player having two visits may proceed to play from where the cue ball lies, if a player is snookered and cant hit the center of their allocated balls, Cue ball in Hand should be called and this is to be played according rule 8(B) general, if the player chooses this option.</li>
						<li>On the first shot only of the first visit, the oncoming player may, without nomination, play the cue ball on to any ball without penalty, including any opponent’s ball(s), or 8 ball (black). If any object ball(s) is pocketed directly, or by combination, the player is deemed to have pocketed a legal ball(s), and continues with the first visit. However, the player must not pot the 8 ball (black), which would mean loss of game. Except if the player is on the 8 ball (black), then the game would be won. When the player fails to pot a ball on the first or subsequent shot of the first visit, play then continues with the second visit. The second visit is deemed to have started when the cue ball is struck on the first shot of the second visit.

					<li> A player pocketing the 8 ball (black) and any other ball on the same shot will lose the game. Except following a foul when only the 8 ball (black) and ball(s) of the opponents group are on the table, then with the first shot of the first visit, the player may legally pocket the 8 ball (black) as well as ball(s) of the opponent’s group by any combination and in any order.</li>
					<li> A player who clearly fails to make any attempt to play a ball of their own group will lose the game.</li>
				</ol>

								<li>Touching any ball the player is legally entitled to play. The player may choose either:
								<ol type="i">
									<li>Play away from the touching ball, and be deemed to have played that ball. Should the cue ball fail to make contact with any ball, or strike the opponents ball, or 8 ball (black), then the shot is fair, no foul.</li>

				<dt>9. STALEMATE</dt>

				<p>If in the opinion of the referee neither player is allowing the game to progress, or a stalemate situation has arisen, then the game shall be restarted by the player who started that frame. The referee shall not allow numerous visits with neither player making any attempt to make the opening pot which decides the playing groups (unless it is felt that progress is being made). If the player who started that frame did so by virtue of their opponent making a foul break, that player will break on any restart, not the opponent who made the foul break.</p>
